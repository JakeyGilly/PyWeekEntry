# Chase (PyWeek Entry)
This is a game built in python by [Jake](https://github.com/JakeyGilly/) and [Finn](https://github.com/Explorer017/). It requires PyGame in Python 3. This game is a entry for the [PyWeek 31](https://pyweek.org/e/IdkIveGotRevise/) Game Jam based around the theme ```Cops/Police```
## Our Idea
We thought of many ideas and wouldnt decide what to pick so we used a randomizer wheel. We ended up going with a Car chase idea where the police are chasing the player and you need to lose them.
